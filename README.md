# How efficient are LSTMs at predicting stock market?
In assignment-1, we compare two methods: deep learning and conventional statistical regression, to showcase the unpredictability and volatility of forecasting stock market prices. The data we had was intra stock .pkl files for 4 days and our aim was to predict close price at t+15 and t+3 mins.

In assignment 2, we are given micro-transactions for a particular stock and are asked to retire some features and make statistical predictions. The data for both assignments can be shared with a reasonable request.
